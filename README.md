Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS (trusty) | gcc-arm-none-eabi-6-2017-q1 | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ncesnagoya/asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ncesnagoya/asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed)

## TOPPERS/ASP Kernel

TOPPERS/ASP kernel is a sophisticated real-time kernel for embedded real-time systems.
ASP stands for Advanced Standard Profile which is improved version of the standard profile defined in μITRON4.0 specification. 

TOPPERS/ASP kernel has been distributed with [TOPPERS License](http://toppers.jp/en/license.html).
The detail specification of TOPPERS/ASP kernel can be found at Refereces in this page.

# Software Development Enviroment

## Web compiler
- Web compiler provided by RENESAS is highly recommended for all beginners.
- You can get started programming WITHOUT installing software in your computer.
  - [Get Started for beginners](https://github.com/ncesnagoya/asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed/wiki/GetStarted)
- No high functional debugging such like breakpoints, step-by-step execution, etc. are provided. If you want to use them, command line or IDE should be helpful for you.
## IDE
- TrueSTUDIO Lite is high quality, integrated development environment, and free to download and use.
- This tool can be used for high functional debugging and is recommended for beginners who want to build the development environment in their local computer.
- The All-in-One package including all source code and the kernel configurator (i.e. cfg) is newly provided for TrueSTUDIO.
- Only the following **4 steps** are needed to build examples.
  1. Download the installer of TrueSTUDIO v8.1.0 for ARM [here](https://atollic.com/resources/download/) or older and install it. Please do NOT use v9.0.0 or newer because they are for STM32, not for ARM.
  2. Download a zip file (e.x. [asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed-1.0.0-AllinOne.zip](https://github.com/ncesnagoya/asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed/tree/v1.0.0-AllinOne)) of the All-in-One package and Unzip it. If you use Linux or MacOS machine, rename ROOTDIR(e.x. asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed-1.0.0-AllinOne)/asp-1.9.2-utf8/cfg/cfg/[cfg.linux|cfg.macos] to cfg (delete its extension).
  3. Launch TrueSTUDIO and specify ROOTDIR/examples/truestudio as your workspace.
  4. Choose an example project in Project Explorer and Push build (hammer) icon. That's all!
- You can find the detailed installation manual provided by attolic and A.I.Corporaiton.
  - [Using the TOPPERS/ASP (RTOS) with the mbed/Arduino library on GR-PEACH (Cortex-A9) With Atollic TrueSTUDIO](https://github.com/ncesnagoya/asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed/blob/master/docs/TrueSTUDIO_GR-PEACH-With_mbed_Arduino.pdf) (Many thanks to [A.I.Corporation](http://www.aicp.co.jp/en/index.html) for the great manual and their supports!)
## Command Line
1. Install development tools including ARM cross-compilers and source code in your computer. Please read the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/ncesnagoya/asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed/wiki/InstallationAndBuilding) for more details.
2. Download source code from GitHub as follows
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/ncesnagoya/asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed.git
    $ cd asp-gr_peach_gcc-mbed
    $ git submodule update -i 
```
